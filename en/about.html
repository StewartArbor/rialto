  Rialto was created as a personal filtering system for navigating AliExpress,
  where useful products are often buried under large volumes of low-quality,
  misleading, or repetitive listings. The project focuses on identifying items
  that are practical, reasonably priced, and consistent over time.

  Rather than relying on artificial urgency or promotional tactics, the site
  emphasizes selection and maintenance, with products being added, reviewed,
  and removed based on their continued relevance and value.

  Some links are affiliate links, which allows the project to remain independent
  and self-sustaining without affecting prices for users.
